# ChatRoom-ReactJS
Created a simple ChatRoom using reactJS, babel, webpack, nodeJS and backend database was handled on firebase (firebase.google.com).

You can use this react app to create a chat room when all the members in the chat room connect to the same firebase database (same code snippet for firebase in index.html)
